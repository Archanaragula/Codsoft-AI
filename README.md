# AI Internship at CodSoft

### Overview

This repository contains the projects and tasks I completed during my AI Internship at CodSoft. The internship provided hands-on experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning, working on projects that focus on rule-based systems, game theory, and recommendation algorithms.

### Projects

 ### Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot
- Developed a chatbot that responds to user queries using predefined rules and patterns.
- Implemented conditional logic and string matching techniques to handle user inputs and provide meaningful responses.
- The project demonstrates an understanding of basic natural language processing (NLP) and conversation flow design.

### Technologies:
- Python
### Key Features:
- If-else rule-based logic for handling user queries.
- Simple, interactive conversation flow.

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
- Created a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal moves, making it unbeatable.
- The AI calculates the best possible move by evaluating the game board and chooses the one that minimizes the potential loss.

### Technologies:
- Python

### Key Features:
- AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions.
- Supports human vs. AI gameplay.


### Task 3: Recommendation System
- Built a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences.
- Implemented collaborative filtering to recommend items such as movies or products based on user interaction data.

### Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Key Features:
- Content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.
- Recommends items based on user similarity or item similarity.

### Skills Developed
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Game Theory and Search Algorithms (Minimax)
- Recommendation Algorithms (Collaborative Filtering)
- Python Programming
- Data Analysis and Machine Learning

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (optional, for advanced tasks)

### Conclusion
The AI Internship at CodSoft provided me with the opportunity to work on real-world AI applications, strengthening my skills in machine learning, game theory, and recommendation systems. Each task allowed me to explore different areas of artificial intelligence and deepen my understanding of AI technologies.
